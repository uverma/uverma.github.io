I obtained Ph.D. degree in image processing from the [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), University of Paris-Saclay, Paris, France under the guidance of [Isabelle Bloch](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/bloch/) and [Florence Rossant](https://sites.google.com/site/rossantflorence/home/about-me). I completed M.S. (Research) degree in signal and image processing from [IMT Atlantique](http://imt-atlantique.fr/), France. I am  currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, India. My research interests include computer vision and machine learning for Earth observation images, with a focus on self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, semantic segmentation, and classification of UAV and satellite images and video. 

I am a recipient of the  [“ISCA Young Scientist Award 2017–2018”](http://www.sciencecongress.nic.in/young_scientists_awards_17-18.php) by the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), a professional body under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. I am the Co-Chair of the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. I am also an Associate Editor of IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. I am a Guest Editor for Special Issues in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, and a Reviewer for several journals (IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, and IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters). I am also a Sectional Recorder for the ICT Section of the Indian Science Congress Association from 2020 to 2024. I am a Life Member of the Indian Science Congress Association.
